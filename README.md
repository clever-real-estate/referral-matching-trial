# Referral Matching Pilot

A small full-stack application for a referral-matching pilot: customer referrals
arrive from an upstream lead platform, the system identifies and ranks candidate
agents, agents claim referrals from a queue, and Operations monitors the whole
flow.

**If you were sent this repository as part of a hiring trial, start with
[CANDIDATE_BRIEF.md](CANDIDATE_BRIEF.md).**

All data in this repository is synthetic. Names, emails, and phone numbers are
fabricated (phones use the reserved 555-01xx range).

## Stack

- **Backend:** Python / Django / Django REST Framework / PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React / TypeScript / Vite
- **Tests:** pytest, Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Infra:** Docker Compose (PostgreSQL only)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node 20+
- Docker with the Compose plugin
- GNU Make

## Quickstart

```bash
make setup     # start Postgres, create venv, install deps, run migrations
make seed      # load deterministic trial data (prints sign-in identities)
make dev       # run backend (:8000) and frontend (:5173) together
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 and pick an identity from the top-right
dropdown. `make seed` prints the full identity list; useful ones:

| Identity      | Role  | Token             | Notes                          |
| ------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `agent.carol` | agent | `tok-agent.carol` | Active Denver agent            |
| `agent.tessa` | agent | `tok-agent.tessa` | Dallas agent                   |
| `ops.riley`   | ops   | `tok-ops.riley`   | Operations dashboard access    |

Authentication uses DRF token auth. The identity dropdown is a development
convenience backed by `GET /api/identities/` (DEBUG only). For direct API
calls: `Authorization: Token tok-agent.carol`.

If port 5433 is busy on your machine, override it:
`POSTGRES_PORT=5444 make setup` and set `DB_PORT=5444` when running backend
commands (see `.env.example`).

## Commands

| Command              | What it does                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `make setup`         | One-time environment setup               |
| `make seed`          | Reset and reseed the database            |
| `make dev`           | Run backend + frontend                   |
| `make test`          | Backend + frontend test suites           |
| `make test-backend`  | pytest suite                             |
| `make test-frontend` | Vitest suite                             |
| `make lint`          | ruff, eslint, and tsc                    |
| `make db-up/db-down` | Start/stop PostgreSQL                    |

## Simulating the upstream platform

The upstream lead platform delivers referrals by webhook. Simulate it locally:

```bash
# One new referral
python tools/send_webhook.py

# The same delivery retried twice (as the upstream platform does on timeout)
python tools/send_webhook.py --repeat 2 --same-event-id

# Concurrent requests against any endpoint
python tools/generate_load.py --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ops/referrals/ \
    --token tok-ops.riley --count 10
```
